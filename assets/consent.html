                    <p>
                        <b>Purpose:</b> We are conducting research on how we see,
                        think about, and interact with objects and people in our physical environment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Brief description:</b> In this experiment, you will make
                        judgments about various properties of objects and/or agents.
                        In total, we think making these judgments will take less than 20 minutes to complete.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Procedures:</b> For each judgement, you will see an image
                        or a brief video of static or moving objects and/or agents and
                        your job is to make judgments about the objects or agents
                        including the shape or positions of objects or the goals and
                        actions of agents. You will receive $15.00/hour upon completing the experiment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Risks and Benefits:</b> Completing this task poses no more
                        risk of harm to you than do the experiences of everyday life
                        (e.g., from working on a computer). Although this study will
                        not benefit you personally, we hope it will contribute to the
                        advancement of our understanding of the human mind.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Confidentiality:</b> All of the responses you provide
                        during this study will be anonymous. You will not be asked
                        to provide any identifying information, such as your name,
                        in any of the questionnaires. Typically, only the researchers
                        involved in this study and those responsible for research
                        oversight will have access to the information you provide.
                        However, we may also share the data with other researchers
                        so that they can check the accuracy of our conclusions;
                        this will not impact you because the data are anonymous.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The researcher will not know your name, and no identifying
                        information will be connected to your survey answers in any
                        way. The survey is therefore anonymous. However, your
                        account is associated with an Prolific number that the
                        researcher has to be able to see in order to pay you,
                        and in some cases these numbers are associated with public
                        profiles which could, in theory, be searched. For this reason,
                        though the researcher will not be looking at anyone’s public
                        profiles, the fact of your participation in the research
                        (as opposed to your actual survey responses) is technically
                        considered “confidential” rather than truly anonymous.
